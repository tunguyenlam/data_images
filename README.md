Google Cloud's Anti-Money Laundering (AML) product flow typically involves several stages, from data preparation and ingestion to model training and deployment. While the exact steps may vary based on the specific requirements of the financial institution, here's a general overview of how you might use Google Cloud's AML product to create an end-to-end solution:

In machine learning, the choice of evaluation metric is critical and depends on the specific problem being solved. It appears that in this context, the recall metric is being used instead of the AUC (Area Under the Curve) metric. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the ability of a model to identify all relevant cases in a dataset. In the context of anti-money laundering, high recall means the model can identify a significant portion of potentially fraudulent transactions.

Additionally, optimizing the model to maximize the fraction of target predictions that are actually positive (i.e., optimizing for true positives) is crucial in AML applications. This optimization strategy aims to reduce false negatives, ensuring that the model catches as many potentially fraudulent activities as possible.

Using recall as the primary metric and optimizing for true positives suggests a focus on improving the model's ability to identify suspicious transactions accurately, which is a common objective in AML applications to minimize financial risks and comply with regulations.
