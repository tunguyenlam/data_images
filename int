What made me join HSBC were the people I had conversations with during the interview process, all of whom were very data-driven, highly motivated. Joining HSBC will give me the chance to work in creative, collaborative environment in which we seek to develop reliable and fantastic financial solutions.
 I have been working in Software Development and Data Science for 10 years and really interested into this field. I had good chances to join Analytics/Machine Learning projects in different companies such as DBS bank, Ascend Group Co., Ltd. ... They are related to financial and digital wallets: we build anomaly detection system, Natural Language Processing, Recommendation System. Without doubt, this field is the future of data-driven market, so I believe that there would be many things to do for me to work on with lifelong passion.  
Personally, I do a bit exercise  in the morning and have quick shower. I love playing football and watching football. I do it at the weekend with my friends. Sometimes, I go camping and BBQ with my friends at East Coast or Pasir Ris. We together enjoy weekend moments and hangout.
